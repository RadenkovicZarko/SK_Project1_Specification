# Storage Management Library

Overview
The Storage Management Library is a Java-based project designed to facilitate operations on file storage systems. It allows users to perform a variety of operations such as creating directories, uploading files, and searching through storage with ease. The library is built with flexibility in mind, supporting both local file systems and remote storage solutions like Google Drive.

# Features

Creation and configuration of storage directories
Uploading, downloading, deleting, and moving files
Directory and file searching with various filters (e.g., by name, extension, creation/modification date)
Support for file metadata operations
Configurable storage constraints (e.g., size limits, restricted file types)
Two separate implementations for local and Google Drive storage
This repository is just specification. Two implementations are in repositories: SK_Project1_GoogleDriveImplementation, SK_Project1_LocalStorageImplementation


# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Java 11 or later
Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
Access to Google Drive API (for the Google Drive implementation)


## Building from Source
To build the Storage Management Library from source and install it on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine
2.Use Maven to clean the existing builds and compile the project: mvn clean install



After successfully building and installing the project, you can include it as a dependency in your Maven projects by adding the following to your pom.xml file (make sure to replace x.y.z with the actual version of the library you've installed):
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yourdomain</groupId>
    <artifactId>storage-management-library</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>





# Testing
To test the Storage Management Library, you will need to download and install two additional repositories, along with the test repository. Follow the steps below to set up your environment for testing.

Step 1: Clone the Repositories
First, clone this repository as well as two additional repositories required for testing(SK_Project1_GoogleDriveImplementation, SK_Project1_LocalStorageImplementation), also you should clone SK_Project1_TestApk repository. 

Step 2: Install the Projects
Navigate to each cloned repository's root directory and run the Maven install command. This will compile the projects and install them to your local Maven repository, making them available as dependencies.
Command for all three repositories (SK_Project1_Specification, SK_Project1_GoogleDriveImplementation, SK_Project1_LocalStorageImplementation) is mvn clean install

Step 3: Run main in project SK_Project1_TestApk
